Map and level files for Syndicate Wars Port.

## About

**Syndicate Wars Port**, alternative binary for the classic Bullfrog game.

Alongside fixes to the game executable code, an updated set of assets is
required to use the full potential of the code fixes.

This repository contains the original maps and levels developed by
Bullfrog, with additional fixes applied to the files by fan community.

## Installation

Copy the `LEVELS` and `MAPS` folder to a previous Syndicate Wars Port
installation, replacing the existing files.

## Done

That's all. See more documentation in [Syndicate Wars Port repo](https://github.com/mefistotelis/swars).
